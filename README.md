# Chip Player JS - Docker

Lets' create your own [Chip Player JS (soltune's fork)](https://github.com/soltune/chip-player-js) music library easily by Docker!

## Preparation 

### Install Docker
First, install Docker Engine onto your host OS before proceeding to the instructions below.

- Linux
    - [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
    - [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
    - [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/)
    - [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- OSX
    - [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
- Windows
    - [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)

As I personally don't have Windows, this project may not be work on it ...

### Install Git
Install Git or any good clients onto your host OS if you have not done yet.  
I suggest you to visit [GitHowTo](https://githowto.com/) if you're a newbie.

## How to Setup

### 1. Clone project
After cloning this repository, create www directory and firebaseConfig.js (from firebaseConfig.example.js) like this.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/soltune/chip-player-js-docker.git
$ cd chip-player-js-docker
$ mkdir www
$ cp ./build/firebaseConfig.example.js ./build/firebaseConfig.js
```

### 2. Prepare Firebase account and Edit your settings **(Optional)**
Prepare [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/?hl=ja) to save your settings on the player.  
Although using Firebase is free, please note that Firebase requires domain name to be functional. 
So this step can be skipped if you run this project on your localhost(or your local network) only.

Just edit firebaseConfig.js in ./build/ directory with your favourite text editor.

### 3. Prepare rhythm files
Some file formats, S98, PMD and FMP, require additional samples to play rhythm tracks.  
Just place the following files on ./build/rhythm/ directory. (each names are case sensitive!)

- 2608_BD.WAV
- 2608_HH.WAV
- 2608_RIM.WAV
- 2608_SD.WAV
- 2608_TOM.WAV
- 2608_TOP.WAV
- ym2608_adpcm_rom.bin

### 4. Prepare the instrument rom file
Put yrw801.rom that is YMF278(OPL4) instrument file into ./build/roms/.

### 5. Prepare additional soundfonts **(optional)**
By adding soundfonts into ./build/soundfonts/ directory improve sound quality for midi files.
Available .sf2 files can be found at [MIDIPlayer.js](https://github.com/soltune/chip-player-js/blob/develop/src/players/MIDIPlayer.js#L10).

### 6. Place music files
Put chiptune files into ./catalog directory to create your own music library!  
The player supports the following file types;

| ext |                       summary                       |

This step also can be done later. Refer [Update Catalog Only](#update-catalog-only) section for the details.

### 7. First build on Docker
Build whole resources on Docker by launching build container on ./build/ directory;

```sh
cd ./build/ && docker-compose up
```

This step will take a few minutes(around 10 minutes on MBP 2013), so please be patient until the following message shown.

```sh
chipplayerjs-build_1  | Done in 141.81s.
build_chipplayerjs-build_1 exited with code 0
$  <- return to prompt
```

### 8. Launch Web Servers on Docker
Finally, let's launch both nginx and nodejs servers;

```sh
$ cd ../server/ && docker-compose up -d
```

To browse your library, open [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) with your browser.

## Operations
### Launch Servers
When you restart your host OS you'll need relaunch the servers on Docker.

```sh
$ cd ./server/ && docker-compose up -d
```

### Shutdown Servers
To stop your servers, just like the following;

```sh
$ cd ./server/ && docker-compose down
```

### Update Catalog Only
The catalog must be updated when any changes(add/remove/modify) made in ./catalog directory.

```sh
$ cd ./build/ && docker-compose run chipplayerjs-build bash -c "yarn run build-catalog && cp ./public/catalog* ./public/directories.json /usr/share/www/" && cd ../server/ && docker-compose restart
```

### Update Chip Player JS
This operation updates Chip Player JS along with catalog to latest. 

```sh
$ cd ./build/ && docker-compose up && cd ../server/ && docker-compose restart
```
